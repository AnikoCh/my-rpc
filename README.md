            "details": f"Aincrad {current_floor}",  # anything you like
            "timestamps": {
                "start": start_time
            },
            "assets": {
                "small_text": "Online",  # anything you like
                "small_image": "green",  # must match the image key
                "large_text": "Swordsman - Level 10",  # anything you like
                "large_image": "default"  # must match the image key
            },
            "buttons": [ # optional, add if you want buttons
                {"label": "??? Sword Art Online ???", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onYSNgHbbW8&ab_channel=Gigguk"}, 
                {"label": "*----* ðŸ…¶ðŸ…¸ðŸ†ƒðŸ…·ðŸ†„ðŸ…± *----*", "url": "https://github.com/MahdeenSky"} # label = button text, url = link to redirect on click

<!-- EXAMPLE -->
## Example
I have included the example provided inside the Example Folder, that you can run if you fill it in by recreating the app, which involves 
1. making an app with the name "Sword Art Online"
2. adding the "default" and "green" assets
3. editing the visualizer section as shown above
4. placing the client ID inside the main.py script.

Finally run `python3 main.py`
